## About
A program that will help users with their trading of online stocks while profiting. If the stocks were to go south for any reason, this program will lower the loss of investment as it keeps maintaining standard line of our minimum profits.


## How it works
**For new user:** This program will ask their Firstname, Lastname , Broker Account Username, Broker Account Password, and email. After that, the program should redirect to your dashboard and show your recent activities based on the broker account you provided. (Note: Broker Account connection to our database is not implemented yet in our current version.) 

**Usage:** You will be given an option to choose whether you want to automate the selling and buying at any given moment if opportunity arises. There will be a setting you can choose for timeframe which you want to allow our program to do actions with some limitation on stock amounts or you can choose our methods which will manage your stocks using our algorithms to gain profits.
